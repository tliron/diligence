<h1>Diligence's Sencha Integration Library</h1>
<p>
	We love, love, love Ext JS, which is by far the best client-side JavaScript framework, and its mobile cousin
	Sencha Touch, and wanted Diligence to do them justice. We're happy with the result! This is a <i>big</i> library, with
	lots of examples and explanations, so get yourself a cup of coffee, tea or yerbamatte, and get comfy.

<h2>General Comments</h2>

<h3>Extended JSON</h3>
<p>
	Off the bat, let's mention we added support for MongoDB's extended JSON notation to Ext JS,
	specifically for $date and $long. This allows you to easily send JSON
	coming from MongoDB straight to the client and not worry about having to massage the data.
	Moreover, you can make use of extended JSON without MongoDB, making it easy to pass
	dates directly to the client.
</p>


<h3>Client-Side Caching with Prudence</h3>
<p>
	By default, Ext JS and almost all other client-side JavaScript frameworks and widgets enable an
	annoying form of client cache overriding in their communication with the server. You'll see in all our
	examples here that we're explicitly turning off Ext JS's cache overriding. Why? Because in
	Diligence this is unnecessary: Prudence lets us do the right thing and actually use client-side caching
	to our benefit. 
</p>
<p>
	What's with the cache bashing, anyway? The story is that most server-side containers don't offer
	good support for conditional HTTP, which means that clients (the web browsers in which the client-side
	frameworks run) treat <i>all</i> data coming from the same URL as cacheable. If you attempt
	to hit the same URL twice, the browser will try to optimize and use its already cached data.
	In many cases, this is <i>not</i> what you want, because the data from the server may be different
	upon subsequent requests.
</p>	 
<p>
	Ext JS and other client-side frameworks get around this problem by changing the URL for each
	request. A random or timestamp-based query parameter is added to the URL, so the web browser
	must consider it different from previous requests, and will not use its cache. The new request,
	in fact, will have no cache to fall back to. At the other end, the server ignores this extra
	query parameter and just generates and returns its data as usual. 
</p>
<p>
	This is a <i>terrible</i> solution! Think about it: every single request will be cached, but that
	cached data will never be used again, because the exact URL will not be used again. It's a waste
	of resources on the client. And why not make use of the cache when appropriate? If the data
	on the server indeed did not change since we last hit it, we can save lots of resources and
	bandwidth by not generating data and instructing the client to use its cached version. Multiply
	that by thousands of clients and thousands of requests, and you've increased your ability to
	scale up.
</p>
<p>
	(It's not just the client that suffers: proxies, gateways and caches along the way, whether at
	the hosting backbone infrastructure, or at various points along the internet/intranet on the
	way to the client, will also not be able to optimize these requests, and may even waste
	resources on an optimization that is devilishly bypassed.)
</p>
<p>
	Diligence does the right thing: data from the server is returned with a timestamp, which is then compared
	to the client's cached version. Moreover, Diligence uses <a href="http://threecrickets.com/prudence/manual/resources/#toc-Subsubsection-83">Prudence's handleGetInfo()</a>
	to fetch <i>only</i> the timestamp <i>before</i> fetching all the data, so that HTTP can be truly conditional. Thus, only if the client has an
	outdated version is handleGet called and the data generated. Lots of MongoDB requests can be entirely
	avoided!
</p>
<p>
	Even if the timestamp changes for every single request, you still have an important advantage:
	because the URL is constant, the new version coming from the server will replace the cached
	version the client maintains for that URL. So, while you're not saving resources on the server
	in such super-dynamic situations, you are still saving resources on the client.
</p>
<p>
	Let's do HTTP right, OK?
