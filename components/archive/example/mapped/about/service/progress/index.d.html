<h1>Diligence's Progress Service</h1>
<p>
	If you've read Prudence's <a href="http://threecrickets.com/prudence/scaling/">Scaling Tips</a> article, you know
	that for potentially long-running tasks you want to release conversation threads as soon as possible, and notify
	the user in some way as to when the task is finished. This service helps you do it.
</p>
<p>
	For a use case example, consider an application that searches for flight information using
	several off-site databases and services. The search can take many seconds, if not minutes!
	Of course, you do not want to hold up a user thread and have the browser spin while the search is
	going on, so you turn to Diligence's processing service.
</p>
<p>
	It works like this: you create a "process," which is a MongoDB document, and you can asynchronously update "milestones" in it, including
	marking it as done. Processes can be associated with a user, which allows you to use the <a href="../authorization/">authorization service</a>
	to allow only that user access to the process' status, and also to allow the user to query all processes associated
	with them. 
</p>
<p>
	The service supports two ways of letting the user know the status of the process. The first is for short-term processes:
	a /web/fragments/ drop-in that simply shows the current status of the process, and uses browser JavaScript to refresh
	the page every few seconds. The user would see milestones along the way to completion, if there are any, and eventually
	be redirected to another page when the process completes (or fails!).
</p>
<p>
	For longer running processes, you cannot expect the user to wait in front of their web browsers. In these cases, the
	processing service uses the <a href="../notification/">notification service</a> to notify the user about changes to the process.
	Additionally, there is a /web/fragments/ drop-in that would allow the user to see the current state of the process on
	the web, and another one that lets the user access all proccesses associated with them.
</p>
<p>
	Refer to the <a href="<%= conversation.pathToBase %>/api/?namespace=Diligence.Progress">Diligence.Progress API documentation</a>
	for more details.
</p>


<h2>Trivial Example</h2>
<p>
	This fake process will simply do nothing until its expiration:
</p>
<pre>
document.executeOnce('/diligence/service/processing/')

var process = Diligence.Progress.startProcess({
	description: 'Waiting for this fake process to expire...',
	maxDuration: 20 * 1000,
	redirect: conversation.reference
})

process.redirectWait(conversation)
</pre>
<p>
	That final redirectWait call will send the user to a "please wait" page which will show "Searching for your flights..." as the text, and
	have a progress bar. The page will automatically refresh and show ongoing progress. After 20 seconds of this, it will redirect
	back to this page. Note that you can specify different redirect URIs for success, error, timeouts, etc.
</p>
<form method="post">
	<input type="hidden" name="type" value="trivial" />
	<input type="submit" value="Click to start this process" />
</form>


<h2>Example with Milestones</h2>
<p>
	You can launch a task, via the Tasks.task API, at the same time as you start a process.
	Conveniently, you can then access the process via the task context:
</p>
<pre>
var searchString = 'flight #1234'
	
var process = Diligence.Progress.startProcess({
	description: 'Searching for your flights...',
	maxDuration: 60 * 1000,
	redirect: '/flight/results/',
	task: {
		name: '/flight/search/',
		searchString: searchString, // this is our custom field
		distributed: true
	}
})
</pre>
<p>
	Our "/tasks/flights/search.js" would look like this:
</p>
<pre>
document.executeOnce('/diligence/service/processing/')

var process = Diligence.Progress.getProcess()
if (process && process.isActive()) {
	var task = process.getContext()['diligence.task']
	var milestone = process.getLastMilestone()
	switch (milestone.name) {
		case 'started':
			process.addMilestone({name: 'ours', description: 'Searching our flight database'})
			var found = searchOurDatabase(task.searchString)
			if (found) {
				process.addMilestone({name: 'done'})
			}
			else {
				Tasks.task(task)
			}
			break
			
		case 'ours':
			process.addMilestone({name: 'partners', description: 'Searching our partner databases'})
			var found = searchPartnerDatabases(task.searchString)
			if (found) {
				process.addMilestone({name: 'done'})
			}
			else {
				process.addMilestone({name: 'failed'})
			}
			break
	}
}
</pre>
<p>
	Note that we've handled each milestone as a new execution of the task (the first milestone
	is always "started").
	This allows for better concurrency (the task is distributed, too, so each milestone might be executed on a different
	instance in the cluster), and also makes sure that a milestone is not performed if the process
	expires and is thus not longer active (isActive would return false).
</p>
<form method="post">
	<input type="hidden" name="type" value="milestones" />
	<input type="submit" value="Click to start this process" />
</form>


<h2>Reattempts</h2>
<p>
	A common use case for the processing service is in dealing with an unreliable action that might actually succeed after
	a few attempts. You'd thus want to let the user wait until a certain maximum duration, and keep retrying every few
	seconds in the background until the action succeeds.
</p>
<p>
	The processing service automates much of this:
</p>
<pre>
var ipAddressOfRemoteLocation = '1.2.3.4' 
var process = Diligence.Progress.startProcess({
	description: 'Attemping to connect you to remote location {0}...'.cast(ipAddressOfRemoteLocation),
	maxDuration: 5 * 60 * 1000,
	redirect: '/remote/connected/',
	task: {
		fn: '/remote/connect/',
		maxAttempts: 50,
		delay: 5000,
		remoteLocation: ipAddressOfRemoteLocation // this is our custom field
	}
})
</pre>
<p>
	Our "/tasks/remote/connect.js" would look something like this:
</p>
<pre>
document.executeOnce('/diligence/service/processing/')

var process = Diligence.Progress.getProcess()
if (process) {
	process.attempt(function(process, task) {
		document.executeOnce('/mylibrary/connections/')
		return connectRemote(task.remoteLocation)
	})
}
</pre>
<p>
	The process.attempt call doest most of the work: it makes sure to call the task again if there's still time before
	the process expires and the maximum number of attempts has not been exceeded, waiting the appropriate delay before
	each attempt. Your function just has to make sure to return true if the attempt has succeeded. Easy!
