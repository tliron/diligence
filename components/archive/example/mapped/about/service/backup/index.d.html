<h1>Diligence's Backup Service</h1>
<p class="note">
	Still working on documenting this feature, though it's otherwise pretty complete!
</p>
<p>
	Refer to the <a href="<%= conversation.pathToBase %>/api/?namespace=Diligence.Backup">Diligence.Backup API documentation</a>
	for more details.
</p>


<h2>What It Does</h2>
<p>
	Let's you do a live export of your MongoDB databases and collections to JSON, optionally gzipping the output
	to save space. You can set up your application's crontab to have the backup run regularly.
</p>
<p>
	Backups are very, very fast: even very large databases can be fully exported in durations measured in seconds
	or minutes. 
</p>


<h2>Why Not Use MongoDB's mongodump or mongoexport Tools?</h2>
<p>
	From our experience, the admin tools that come with MongoDB are overly simplistic and unreliable.
</p>
<p>
	Otherwise, Diligence's backup service offers the following advantages: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Thoughput: Because we're using the Java MongoDB driver underneath, with its support for connection pooling,
		we can achieve much higher througput than the command line tools, which use a single connection. The default
		is to use 5 threads (and thus 5 connection at most) at once.
	</li>
	<li>
		True JSON: The mongoexport tool does not export a real JSON array, instead it exports each document as a JSON dict,
		separating each document with a newline. Diligence exports a standard JSON array, readable from any standard JSON
		parser.
	</li>
	<li>
		Consistency: Works with the same MongoDB connection as your application, guaranteeing that you're backing up
		<i>exactly</i> the same data your application sees. This is especially important in a sharded or replica set
		deployment.
	</li>
	<li>
		Fully integrated: You don't have to create bash scripts to backup your DB. Instead, you can stay in JavaScript
		and Diligence and your regular application code.
	</li>
	<li>
		Iterators: The backup service uses Diligence <a href="../../foundation/iterators/">iterators</a>, so you can transform
		your data in various ways while backing up, or even include non-MongoDB data.
	</li>
</ul>
