<h1>Diligence's Authorization Service</h1>
<p>
	When used with the <a href="../authentication/">authentication service</a>, this service lets you secure your
	site by allowing only authorized users to access certain resources or perform certain operations.
</p>
<p>
	Refer to the <a href="<%= conversation.pathToBase %>/api/?namespace=Diligence.Authorization">Diligence.Authorization API documentation</a>
	for more details.
</p>

<h2>Entities and Inheritence</h2>
<p>
	Permissions are associated with "entities," which could be either inidividual users (from the
	<a href="../authentication/">authentication service</a>), or groups, which are here stores in a simple
	MongoDB collection. 
</p>
<p>
	Each entity can inherit permissions from any number of other entities, in order. The common
	use case is for a user to "belong" to a few groups, and inherit their permissions. This
	lets you centrally manage permissions for large groups of users, and easily change a user's
	permission profile by changing their groups. Entities can inherit from other entities, and
	so on.
</p>
<p>
	Permissions will be overriden by the inheritor: for example, if you specifically grant a user
	permission to edit a certain page, they will have this permission even if the group they
	inherit from specifically forbids it. The order of inheritence also allows for overriding.
</p>

<h2>Cascading Permissions</h2>
<p>
	The common practice is to name permissions using a hierarchical dot notation, with each
	level of depth corresponding to moving into a specific section, resource or operation in
	your application. In some cases, it may make sense to treat a permission as if it covers
	all sub-permissions in a hierarchy. Here we call this "cascading permissions."
